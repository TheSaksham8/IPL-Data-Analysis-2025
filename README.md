# IPL-Data-Analysis-2025
# Overview
This project ingests Indian Premier League 2025 data from a cricket API, cleans and models it with Python/SQL, and builds interactive Power BI dashboards for match results, points table, squads, and records.
It is structured as a reproducible pipeline so anyone can fetch raw data, transform it into analytics-ready tables, and refresh the Power BI report locally.
